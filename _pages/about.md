I am an ECE PhD student at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu) with a focus on `Power Electronics`. My graduate research spans HF Power Conversion Topologies, Predictive Control, Electric Motor Drives and Inverters.

Recently, I received my MS degree from [WSU](https://wsu.edu) EECS with a 4.0 GPA, advised by [Dr. Hang Gao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Wj4zV9cAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). My Master's thesis investigated four branches of efforts aiming the modulations and dynamic controls of high-power current-source converters. In my Master's graduating class, I was the recipient of '2024 Outstanding Graduate Student' and '2024 Outstanding TA: Grader/Office Hours'. I also hold a BSc majoring in EEE at [BRACU](https://www.bracu.ac.bd) and received mentorship from [Dr. AKM Azad](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/about/people/akm-abdul-malek-azad-phd) during my senior thesis.

My hobbies include powerlifting and cooking. In my free time, I mostly listen to podcasts, read biographies of famous scientists, watch documentaries, play video games or binge on anime series.
